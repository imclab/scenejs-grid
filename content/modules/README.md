Modules Directory
=================

This directory contains the modules that implement the components of the grid.
The modules are controlled via actions fired on the grid, often by scripts in
the ../scripts directory.

Guidelines
----------

 * Modules encapsulate dependencies on 3rd party libraries, which are kept in ./content/lib
